# Mathematical Concepts in Euclidean Geometry

## Theorem: Pythagorean Theorem

In Euclidean geometry, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that:

> The square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

This can be expressed with the following equation:

$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$

where:
- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse,
- $ a $ and $ b $ are the lengths of the triangle's other two sides.

## Proof: 

Consider a right triangle $ \triangle ABC $ with a right angle at $ B $. By drawing an altitude from point $ B $ to hypotenuse $ AC $, we create two smaller right triangles that are similar to $ \triangle ABC $. Using the properties of similar triangles, we can establish ratios of corresponding sides, which leads to the equality of the ratios of the squares of those sides. Summing these ratios, we arrive at the conclusion that $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $.

## Application:

The Pythagorean theorem has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. For example, in computer graphics, the distance between two points in a plane can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which is essential for rendering images and animations accurately.
